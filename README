liblyrics is an exercise library written in C++.

Its purpose is to provide to a user a simple interface to obtain
song's lyrics from a local database or a web crawler, linked by 
a dispatcher.

It requires the song's author and title.
The library first checks if that song is already in the local database, 
if it's not it searches it on some websites (like chartlyrics.com ), 
it parses the output (if the research was successfull).
Last if finally returns you the complete song's lyric.
