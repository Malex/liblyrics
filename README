Liblyrics is a library written in C++ for excercise.

It gives a simple interface to get the text of songs, by using
a simple system of databases and web crawling, linked by a 
disptacher.

It requires the title and the author of the song (to avoid
possible songs with the same title) and returns the text,
first checking if that song is already in its databse; if not
it searches on some websites (at the moment just using the
chartlyrics.com APIs) for
the song, parses the page obtained so and, if found, puts it into
the database. Then it returns you the text.
