Liblyrics is a library written in C++ for excercise.

It gives a simple interface to get the text of songs, by using
a simple system of databases and web crawling, linked by a 
disptacher.

It requires the title and the author of the song (to avoid
possible songs with the same title) and returns the text,
first checking if that song is already in its databse; if not
it search on some websites (at the moment only lyrics.com) for
the song, parse the page obtained so and, if found, put it into
the database. Then it returns you the text.
