liblyrics is a library written in C++.

Its purpose is to provide to a user a simple interface to obtain
song's lyrics from a local database, a web crawler or both, all 
managed by a dispatcher class.

It requires the song's author and title. But it will provide a search
function for search in the db and other cool stuff.
